Created small app to show and calculate player stats of participants that attend tournaments. I used the challonge.com api to pull and collect this data. I also did the following:
- Designed architecture and development of web application
- Created RESTful API endpoints using Express framework and Node.js
- Created responsive web designs using Ant Design and React and deployed to Heroku
- Implemented PostgreSQL using Objection.js
